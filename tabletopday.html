Join us this Saturday for International Tabletop Day, an annual celebration of board games (started by the lovely folks at geekandsundry.com).

### Who are ReRoll Board Games?
We’re a couple of friends who are trying to build a community around board gaming in Bangalore. We promise it’s not the type of board games you are thinking about :)

### Who is this for?
Newcomers, especially people who’ve only played games like Monopoly, Cluedo, Pictionary, etc. There is a massive world of creative, challenging, and incredibly fun board games out there that we in India don’t ever hear about. This is an opportunity for you to get a glimpse of it.

More than the games themselves, the social experience is fantastic. It is absolutely the number one reason several people play board games regularly. You find out interesting things about your own friends (like how they are incredibly good liars when they need to be). It makes for memorable moments that you’ll be talking about long after it’s over. Most importantly, you’ll definitely leave with more friends than when you walked in. (Or we’ll refund your money :) )

### What kind of games would I play?
Fight off a herd of zombies with your SO. Try to survive and escape the desert after you and your friends crash land your plane. You and your friends are part of a resistance group and will lie, steal, and deceive your way to overthrow the maligned government while trying to identify which of your comrades are secret government spies.

Games include Captain Sonar, Spyfall, Resistance: Avalon, Spaceteam, Cash n Guns, Hanabi, and much more. (Around 30 odd games)

### How much is the ticket?
This ticket is Rs. 500, of which Rs. 300 is redeemable on food and beverages (it’s a very good menu). Rs. 200 is what we charge to cover for the wear and tear on the games, our time, and some profit to allow us to buy new games for future events.
