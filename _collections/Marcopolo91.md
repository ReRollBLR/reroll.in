    comment: A Pallet cleanser of board games! keep on hand for after or before
      something complicated/before the next game. also good as a drinking game.

    comment: So far im two games Deep. very intimidating to new people but once its
      explained pretty easy to understand the symbols and just get going. Will
      Update once i get more plays


      &amp;#35;&amp;#35; update about 5 games in and this is a horrible
      game to teach! If thinking about this and intend to play with a variety of
      people perhaps look at star realms instead.

    comment: Left it at home in Australian. A wonderful game for friends who are up to
      the deeper complexity needs a practice run through before everything
      clicks but once you get it its on.Really keen to play more of it.

    comment: Nice variation/addition especially if you have a smaller number of players
      2-3 adds some of the Europe mechanics without needing to buy Europe on top
      of the base game.

    comment: played it a few times 3 seems to be the perfect number of players.
