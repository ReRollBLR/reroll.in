    comment: Loved the game with multi-player. It was lot of fun. Intense interaction
      increases the fun element. I don&apos;t think it will be a good 2P game,
      at multiplayer level, it is really good.

    comment: Played at a meetup with 5 players. Due to time restraint and space
      constraint, did not enjoy much. Wish to play again.

    comment: >-
      Love playing this game. Although Govind has always won, this game is
      something I can play anytime. It is the tile placement that seals the deal
      for me. 


      Reasons I love:

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41;Simple tile laying but deep thinking involved. At the beginning of each turn, player has to lay down a tile. As the game progresses, this gets more complex due to temple cards. These temple cards are location cards for temples with specifications. A temple can not be excavated without meeting certain specifications. This is what makes it immensely interesting for me.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Objective cards that make it meaty. Although it is not compulsory to fulfill objectives, it sure makes end game scoring satisfying.

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Design and tiles. Just love the quality of the components. The look of each tile and icons are very easy to understand.


      Things that I don&apos;t like:

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Objective cards. Although they are good for end game scoring, some of them are highly ambiguous and that makes it extremely difficult while scoring.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; layout of the map. I wish the grid system was little better and clearly specified on the map. It gets confusing while excavating a temple.

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Certain questions of objective cards are not answered in rulebook. It would have been helpful if examples were provided. 


      Apart from these,there are no negatives that I can find in this gameplay itself. This is one of my absolute favourite game and it will remain so for a long while. The sense of building and expanding is truly satisfying.

    comment: Amerigo is an excellent and solid game. I have played it multiple times
      and will play again, I love some of it&apos;s mechanics. However the
      victory point salad isn&apos;t that catchy. I was also expecting there to
      be a little bit of Amerigo Vespucci theme which was sadly missing. I would
      have enjoyed it more if the theme would have been more actively a part of
      the game. Dice Tower or Cube Tower, whatever it is called is awesome.

    wishlistcomment: Supposed to be one of the best filler game. An excellent 2P auction game.


      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Goal is to create greatest library by acting as
      an Abbott of Church

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; 2 phases- 1st half where people gift to
      monastery, 2nd half is auction for the gifts that player didnt receive.
      1st half, you draw cards and finish entire deck. Players have the option
      of keeping a card, passing to other player &amp;&amp;#35;40;or send
      away&amp;&amp;#35;41; and keeping away to bid upon later.

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Special Church cards with special powers that
      needs to be resolved immediately.

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; 2nd phase players bid for kept away cards with
      their gold cards and try to increase their stock.


      It is a good solid game but I find it too light. I dont care for it
      as of now.

      [b]ME WAIT! [/b]

      Tile Laying games out there. More of a gateway I suppose.

      Players are running sections of city, developing it in multiple ways. 


      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Players have to draw 5 cards in the beginning which are colour coded and has different characters on each.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Dice management- in second phase, player rolls 5 dice. If it is 1-2, player can do public works; 3-4; 5-6 catastrophe will occur in city. These are again colour coded. So based on colour of a dice, respective section of the city will be affected.Catastrophe hits slowly. Once a particular section has taken hits thrice, only then effect will be seen. 

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Third phase is play cards. Cards have cost and money is tight.

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Last phase is comparison between players progress and attaining end of the game bonus tiles.


      Negatives:

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Prestige track- very stefan feld and repetitive


      Although I liked the game, I did not find anything unique in it. There was not much to grab attention as such. I would like to have it but I can wait. [b][size=12] ME WAIT! [/b][/size]

      Played it at Board Game Meetup JIGG with 5 players for the first time.
      Enjoyed it and managed to win with a huge margin. 

      According to me, it is a good family/party game. Not among the best but not bad too.

    comment: It is supposed to be a gateway game and it does serve the purpose of one.
      An excellent game but I found Akrotiri better.

      We have acquired this game recently after playing Castles of Burgundy: The
      Card Game and boy oh boy, this game did not disappoint. It is one of the
      best games designed by Stephan Feld and it deserves all the praise that it
      gets. IMO, this game is better than any other Stefan Feld games I have
      played &amp;&amp;#35;40;Amerigo and In The Year of the
      Dragon&amp;&amp;#35;41;. 

      I knew hype behind this game and its standing in BGG community but still I was skeptical about it. Even when Govind was explaining rules to me, I did not expect much. However it is during gameplay that I fell in love with it.


      Reasons I love the game:


      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Gives the feel of having played a deep euro. The game has incredible depth. I love the fact that I can plan 2-3 rounds ahead. I also love that I can plan entire game and the best strategy to get maximum scores even before starting the game.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Dice worker placement. I hate dice and I hate it when dice rolls screw me &amp;&amp;#35;40;which has happened multiple times&amp;&amp;#35;41; but in Castles of Burgundy, it does not matter. Due to worker tiles, you can balance your dice roll easily. It does not hinder the game in anyway whatsoever. 

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Variety of maps. Player mat provides complex version of map on the other side of it. This makes the game lot more interesting. And each map is different from the other. Love that complexity.

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Replyability. There is enough randomness to ensure that this game will come to our table multiple times. Govind absolutely loves this game which is a bonus.

      5&amp;&amp;#35;41; Limited VP salad. I did not like it much in Amerigo and I am glad Castles has it in a limited scale. That makes the game all the more appealing to me. 


      Things I did not like:

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; RULEBOOK and COMPONENTS:  Rulebook was difficult for me to understand. It is difficult for me to understand rulebooks as it is and Alea has made it as dry as they could. I just could not read it. Thank god Govind loves reading rules.

      Govind and I, we both did not like quality of the components. Player boards are flimsy, token are poor quality and it is just not value for money. Now I understand it is an old game but this is one area where I really wish someone would revamp the whole game.



      That is all. Apart from that, there is nothing I dont like about the game. I LOVE IT.
    wishlistcomment: Have played the card game. Absolutely loved the game but with card game we
      felt it was bit messy. Too many cards, too many things to keep track of.

      We think this game is worth buying and playing over board game.

    comment: We have played this game only once and it got me intrigued enough to buy
      actual game. However it was extremely messy to play it with cards and that
      is the sole reason I am giving it low rating. It occupies a huge table
      space but a really interesting game.

    wishlistcomment: One of the best exploration games according to Gov. The whole idea is
      exploration, no monsters, no surprises, just exploration. Really

    comment: Its a good game but not for me. I do not like the Dice roll luck factor.
      It makes or breaks the game.

      My no. 1 game so far and I feel it will maintain its position for a long
      time. I have played this game along with its various maps multiple times
      and everytime I get stumped. One of the most beautifully and elegant game
      out there. 


      Reasons I LOVE this game:

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Exceptional rondel system through cards. The 7 cards are the backbone of this game. They make the crux of the game.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Easy gameplay of playing a card which makes it easy to understand and play. That is the reason this game is called ELEGANT. All you do is play one card and thats it. 

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Yes it is a themeless euro, yet it is deep; so much so that I get into long AP mode which I love.

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Player interaction through diplomat and prefect card. Generally I am on the fence about player interaction as I feel it disturbs my thinking process but in this game, it is a subtle one and it pushes the game forward for all. 

      5&amp;&amp;#35;41; A sense of urgency and competition from the get go. Specially during the end, the game takes a very intense turn. 

      6&amp;&amp;#35;41; Luck independent game. I love it when games are not based on luck and if I screw up, then it is completely my fault and not some arbitrary dice roll. This game has no luck element whatsoever according to me. It is all player&apos;s careful planning that matters. If I lose a game, I am ready for another game just to improve myself. Very few game do this for me. 

      7&amp;&amp;#35;41; End game scoring. Although quite a bit of math is involved for end game scoring, it is extremely satisfying as it depends on the cards that you have collected during the game. 


      There is not a single element of this game that I don&apos;t like. I am ready to play it regardless of night and day.

    comment: I have played this game in almost all player combinations except for solo.
      And in all of the plays, I have found this game to be wonderfully
      balanced. There are multiple paths to victory and numerous choices to make
      during the game. For 2p, Sandra works in a very seamless manner and you
      get the feel of having an extra player without any downtime. The game is
      also very thematic which is an added bonus. Can&apos;t wait for this game
      to arrive.

    comment: Very peaceful and a delight to play. Thematic and with right background
      music we definitely got the feeling of being in Hawaii. Despite negative
      reviews from Tom Vasel and others, my husband and I loved the game and can
      see ourselves playing this game multiple times in future.

      Set in 17th C Edo. Board is based on famous painting Nihonbashi which is a
      mural. Economic simulation game.


      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Special characters which give you money, food, etc. They can also get experienced throughout the game.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Market represents Rondel. Based on the place you land on, characters or buildings or actions are available to you. 

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; If you visit other player&apos;s worker through rondel, that worker gets more experience. If s/he retires then it is a huge bonus at the end of the game. Characters are also colour coded so there are points for set collection too.

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Well balanced for 2 player, good use of dummy player.

      5&amp;&amp;#35;41; This is one game which I dont mind buying just for art although gameplay is just as good.


      Medium weight game and really fun.

      Stefan Feld&apos;s most harsh unforgiving game ever.


      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Game is played over 12 rounds depicting each season. Randomly generated seasons. First 2 seasons are going to be good but rest all will be random. It can be good or it can be bad such as sickness or drought.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Depending on the seasons, personalities will get picked who can determine player order.Personalities can be old or young. Old provides resources but less points for player order. 

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Very interesting action selection mechanism. In 2P, there will be 2 sets of actions on the board. Depending on player order, 1st player gets to chose 1 set.

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Simple yet interactive board. Serves the purpose perfectly.


      Very important player order. I dont think we have a game in collection in which player struggles for being 1st in player order. Stefan Feld&apos;s game and not a point salad. Yes! I want to try it so bad.

      Excellent gateway game.


      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Easy to play. Player plays one card and builds 3 houses on the terrain mentioned on card. [b]Just 1 action[/b].

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Like Akrotiri, certain objective cards will be provided based on which you can place your houses. But unlike Akrotiri, these cards are placed beside board and are common to players.

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Board changes every game. The system is like that of Amerigo&apos;s navigation board. Benefits, objectives, terrains all change every game. [b]lots of replay ability [/b]


      Although it is light, those objectives displayed make it thinking game.

    wishlistcomment: Initially was not much interested in the game. After Gov told me about it,
      I am intrigued by it. AND India theme, cant deny it.


      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Dice management like Marco Polo. Depending on the
      value of a die, you can take certain actions. However, once die is on the
      board, you can not retract it. Can also change value of dice.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Every space on Ganges &amp;&amp;#35;40;think Ulm
      type of movement&amp;&amp;#35;41; has certain benefits. Awesome

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Possibility of having more workers through
      various means such as more prestige, money or river road.

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; TILE LAYING through dice management. Along with
      this when you place a tile and it gives you instant benefits through its
      road network. Brilliant!

      5&amp;&amp;#35;41; Interactive and well built game board. Lots of
      things to do.

    wishlistcomment: The sole reason that you get true experience of how entrapment feels like,
      is why I want this game. Along with that Euro mechanisms involved, makes
      it a must buy.


      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Rulebook comes as a journal. Designers dont want
      to boggle down players with rulebook, they want you to start playing as
      soon as game arrives. The game is like video game by same name. Rich
      experience as solo player and while playing multiplayer it has co-op
      element.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Goal is to take characters till ceasefire after
      which their epilogues have to be read.

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Truly a survivor&apos;s struggle to live during
      time of war. Living daily life and how it affects him/her. Robinson Crusoe
      sty;e tools and basic things are used such as sleeping on couch vs bed,
      heater for winter,build a radio etc.

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Characters have special abilities but depend on
      basic things such as cigarettes, hygiene, etc. They get miserable due to
      their conditions or sometimes even depressed.

      5&amp;&amp;#35;41; Game progress from Morning &amp;&amp;#35;40;event
      card which can be good but mostly bad&amp;&amp;#35;41;, Day-3 actions,
      evening and night. Special visitors who arrive at dusk are color coded and
      can be extreme to bearable. One of the main aspect of the game.


      Negative for me:

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Dice roll for success. Although makes sense
      thematically, dice puts me off.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Too intense. I think it will affect me adversely.


      The game is exceptional and should be played. But I think I will
      wait on this one. I will play video game first before going ahead with
      this.

      I like how game has different levels for newbies, intermediate and expert
      level. This is one of the game I want to play for thematic sense as well
      as mechanisms. I really how game sticks to the theme.


      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Solid Engine Building through cards. So with the help of a card you can accumulate points every turn. Based on philosophy- science points; religion-culture points; agriculture-food..so on and so forth

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Multiple options for an action. Too many choices which can change the strategy in future. Extremely deep.

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Multiple strategies to win. No brainer. You can build buildings, develop religion, go military way. Opportunities are endless

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Game is easy to understand and play. Depending on the engine you have built, you take actions. It is the choice that make it deep.

      5&amp;&amp;#35;41; Event cards these can be positive or negative. Again sticking to theme.

      6&amp;&amp;#35;41; Resource management. Building wonders through available resources.

      7&amp;&amp;#35;41; Leaders are like special characters and with each new age, leader changes. Very very interesting.

    comment: >-
      When we first got this game, I was bit skeptical about it because while
      researching Govind came across sentences such as ,&quot;This is another
      TTR&quot;. Because of this, I was under the impression that it is going to
      be a gateway game and I might not enjoy it. While we were unboxing the
      game, I found some cards to be similar to those of Trambahn which is one
      game I absolutely can not stand. So all in all, I had very low
      expectations from the game. 

      However, after playing the game, I was never more happy to be proven wrong. This game is a gem and I am surprised how many people don&apos;t talk about it. 


      Reasons I love the game:

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Building a network of post offices through connecting routes give me a hands on feeling of being involved. I find it very thematic and engaging.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; 4 special abilities make sure that there is always extra to be done in your turn. It is not a simple &apos;take a card, play a card&apos; mechanic.

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Although gameplay is very simple, the game has considerable depth. Just to plan and get the best possible route while installing as many post offices as possible is pretty deep.

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Healthy competition. The game fosters healthy competition where you are competing with other player to get area bonus and multiple other bonus. At the same time, you never intentionally hurt your opponent.

      5&amp;&amp;#35;41; Art and component quality. Classy artwork accompanied by good quality components. Linen finish on the cards make gameplay experience super awesome.

      6&amp;&amp;#35;41; Germany&apos;s early modern map make it really fun to try and read the names aloud. And as a history buff, the theme appeals to me on a personal level.


      All in all, an awesome game which Govind and I can play again and again.

      Based in Ancient Roman Empire,one of the best Stefan Feld games. Almost
      everyone is in Awe of the game. Some of the games are trend setters and as
      Eurogamers, these need to be played and added to the collection. Trajan is
      one of those game. 


      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; MANCALA system- double actions by keeping tiles on the Mancala. &amp;&amp;#35;40; Pick up meeples from mancala and going in clockwise direction, drop each of them in subsequent space. If it is colour matched then you get further bonus&amp;&amp;#35;41;.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Future thinking of 2-3 turns ahead. Game is all about chain actions.

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Literal feeling of building Rome through worker placement and build actions, different tiles for different parts of buildings &amp;&amp;#35;40;set collection in building tiles&amp;&amp;#35;41;

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Shipping action. At the start of the game, you are handed certain goods which are secret to you. You can ship those, get more goods or put them as your VP. 

      5&amp;&amp;#35;41; Interlinking withing the game between various actions. Building, shipping, senate, etc all are linked to get more VPs.


      Negative for me:

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Victory point salad- not a fan of it in Amerigo but want to try it in this.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Similar to Amerigo in setup and tile advantages

      pelicans according to specified conditions.

      It is quick to play, has awesome art &amp;&amp;#35;40;backdrop of
      Ayers Rock of Australia&amp;&amp;#35;41; and nice components. Want this
      game for its simplicity and ease of play.

      Rahdo&apos;s and Govind&apos;s favourite. Gov cant stop raving about it.
      Instead of just vineyard simulation, you feel like you are actually
      running a vineyard. More towards heavy than medium but apparently one of
      the best. 
       The things that interested me:

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Visiting expert acts like a special character wherein s/he gives you a special ability that you can perform in your turn. It becomes part of your collection

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Board is interactive as well as tighter than the first edition. 

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Region-based wine, that is each region produces different types of wine

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Weather affecting the wine. In short real-life stimulation of vineyard.

      5&amp;&amp;#35;41; Every factor of the game can be utilized in some or the other form. Even experts can be sold after their use is done to gain more standing in the society.

      6&amp;&amp;#35;41; Money is tight but can be earned through worker placement. So it is just tight enough to stimulate competition.


      Although it seems to be multiplayer solitaire, it does have limited player interaction. [size=10][b]ME WANT![/b][/size]

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Tile drafting

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; To build Saxxon Palace which is one of the most
      important buildings, you should have LESS number of special tiles in the
      end

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Difference between old building and new building
      needs to be paid

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Tile laying


      It is medium light and it can wait.

    comment: This game actually surprised me with its tile laying mechanism. I have
      played few tile laying games before but Isle of Skye with its trade factor
      puts another spin on the concept. Really intrigued and cant wait to play
      more.

    comment: One of my favourite games. Every play of this game is fun and
      satisfactory.


      Reasons I love this game:

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Well balanced characters. There is not 1
      character that is overpowering than others. All are perfectly well
      balanced.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Thematic. I generally dont care about theme much
      but while playing Marco Polo, I feel I am part of that world and going
      through the same ordeal that Marco might have gone through.

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Dice worker placement. This is one factor that I
      love and hate about this game. I love it because whatever roll is of dice,
      there are multiple actions that you can perform.

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Objectives and contracts. These are the two
      factors that streamlines the game and avoids it from becoming sandboxy.

      5&amp;&amp;#35;41; Deep euro. Even though game is played only over 5
      rounds, it is very deep and you can plan your turns ahead. I love it!


      Things I dont like/understand:

      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Dice placement. Sometimes, if you consistently
      roll less value then it can be little difficult to plan your moves. This
      is not a problem with 2 players but more players, it can become an issue.

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Blocking of places in 2p. Certain places are
      blocked in 2p and we did not understand the reason behind it since values
      of the blocked dice are irrelevant.


      That&apos;s all I can think about. And honestly, these are
      inconsequential reasons. The love I have for this game will never ever go.
