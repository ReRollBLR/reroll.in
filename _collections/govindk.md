    comment: Haven&apos;t played it much at all. My copy has kind of worn off because
      others have played it more than me. I really liked it the one time we
      played, but I have so many other games in my collection I&apos;d rather
      play.

      I am keeping it as it&apos;s a nice next step to games


      Can&apos;t rate it yet

      Love the idea of farming &amp;&amp;#35;40;which I will probably never do
      in real life&amp;&amp;#35;41;


      After watching gameplay, I like Agricola way more than I like Feast for Odin &amp;&amp;#35;40;comparing 2 of Uwe&apos;s big games&amp;&amp;#35;41;...


      1. First and foremost - I am yet to find a euro-gamer who doesn&apos;t like Agricola, they have nothing but praises for it. People even praise it for its theme.

      2. Strategic Worker placement with a lot of replayability.

      3. Resource management with building and worker placement - stop right there!! This is a must buy. 

      4. Card play &amp;&amp;#35;40;choosing&amp;&amp;#35;41; is amazing.

      5. The luck factor in game is non existent, which is great.

      Rahdo&apos;s video helped me make the decision for whether to buy the game
      or not.


      [b]Reasons I own it:[/b]


      - The exploration theme with the gameplay

      - Even don&apos;t theme isn&apos;t my first priority, this one has a strong theme in my opinion and that makes it easy to teach

      - Non-conflicting 

      - 2 player only &amp;&amp;#35;40;I LOVE 2 player games&amp;&amp;#35;41;


      [b]Components and presentation[/b]


      Zman&apos;s Akrotiri has really good components, the tiles are big and chunky, there is something about the temple, it feels like wood but the weighs like a metal. It feels good to hold. The only minor complaint I have is the resource management board - it&apos;s just a thin sheet and if you aren&apos;t careful and bump your play area, there are chances that you might shift things a bit on it. The boat/ship piece is really nice too. I would have like the wooden bits to be a bit more bigger but I see the reason it&apos;s a small size, to accommodate the pieces on the boat&apos;s loading cavity.


      [b]Reasons I like playing it:[/b]


      - The sense of exploration in the game is really great, it&apos;s not so much about exploring the unknown, but more like you chart a course to a known location to try and find/establish a temple

      - Even though you can just pick up the cubes, whenever we play we make sure we load it into the boat and sail our way back to Tera.

      - Akrotiri starts faced paced and becomes slow towards mid-game &amp;&amp;#35;40;after about 8 tiles have come on the play area&amp;&amp;#35;41;, it starts to get deep and thinky

      - Even though there is no take-that element, there is still a tension on the aspect about opponent building a temple before your turn on an island, which blocks you from building on it

      - The cards that tell us where the temple is located is brilliant

      - The objective cards gives you a purpose and direction for placing the temple rather than randomly placing in it any free island

      - I love the AP I go through in this game


      [b]Favourite gameplay mechanisms[/b]


      - I love the no-hassle pick-up &amp; delivery this game has and how the economy is build, you can just randomly delivery cubes of any colour, but that&apos;s not a smart way to do it as it can really limit how much you earn.

      - Oh those awesome awesome map cards with varying difficulty - love them

      - The objective cards make the way you play really unique and not just hurrying up to find a temple

      - I love the Oracle option, once per turn to find your tile that you need

      - The action tokens are nice way to keep track of the actions we have

      - The rewarding aspect of the game, the game always has something for you when you build one of your 6 temple

      - The way the orientation of icons are used for finding the temples is splendid, so you can sit anywhere you like on a play area and it doesn&apos;t matter


      [b]Things I am not very fond of in the game[/b]


      - The point I mentioned in the components carries over to here, I wish there was some kind of indentation on the board to keep the tokens/pieces. Now I understand from a production stand point that would have been expensive.

      - Few objective cards are difficult to score, but this can be easily remedied by visiting the forums on BGG

      - The cubes are really tiny and it can be easily lost, a minor complaint



      Akrotiri is one of my favourite 2 player game in my current collection. We just love playing this game. Renu and I love heavy euro games that makes our brain do some gymnastics but we don&apos;t get to play it every time we want to, Akrotiri is one among few that really scratches that itch for us. Its simple with minimum setup time and we are off. The exploration of a temple is really amazing and the discovery one is just so satisfying. . This game deserves more love than it gets.


      The game is going to be our companion for a while, for sure. I hope designers or the publisher release an expansion with more objectives or release a second edition with new rules but keeping the soul element of the game intact.

    wishlistcomment: Based on Rahdo&apos;s video and quick reading of the rulebook really sold
      the game for me.


      1. The deck building style aspect of resource tokens/chits with the
      cart system before the chits go in bag

      2. The worker placement aspect for taking an action in a specific
      area

      3. Secret objective drafting + the contract you buy mid-game

      4. Extending your player board - freaking awesome

      5. The road track is such amazing way to plan things

      Gerhman&apos;s recommendation!! Really loved the concept and the gameplay
      design. But I want to wait a bit longer before getting Anachrony, even
      though Renu &amp; I love to read and delve into the time-travel and sci-fi
      subject - it&apos;s not as intriguing when playing a board game.

      We are still awe-struck by the Renaissance, medieval history trading games and prefer that as our settings over Sci-Fi, but we thoroughly enjoyed Gaia Project, so maybe that to this.


      Edit: Played the game and it was really well made and deep euro, to its credit it looks like this mean beast with a lot of teeth but when you play it&apos;s so well done that it&apos;s a meekly worker placement resource management game.


      Might buy it, not anytime soon.

      Though I thoroughly enjoyed Shem&apos;s Raiders of the North Sea and will
      play it again, it&apos;s not a game I would add to our collection, Viking
      theme has no appeal to me in board games.


      I saw the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3335PK3RtgA]gameplay of Architects[/url] even before Rahdo&apos;s runthrough and thought it&apos;s a really cool game, but the same thing with Raiders, how somehow it doesn&apos;t captivate me or pique my interest enough to add it to our collection. However, would absolutely love to play it when it arrives. Eager in fact!!



      Edit &amp;&amp;#35;40;May 9th &apos;18&amp;&amp;#35;41;: Played it on tabletopia

    wishlistcomment: A&amp;&amp;#35;41; Game setting - ancient China

      B&amp;&amp;#35;41; Farm&apos;s main crop planning in the beginning
      of the game

      c&amp;&amp;#35;41; Engine Building elements in the farm - sort of.

      -----

      1. Card drafting system where you get to know what veggy your
      customer requires. And adding a neighbouring market is just so cool.

      2. There are returning customers and short term customers. Both with
      their own kind of risks and rewards.

      With customer moods of being angry and sad
      &amp;&amp;#35;40;indicated by tokens&amp;&amp;#35;41; - &quot;just
      amazing.&quot;

      3. The loan system is really nice. Quick reward but end game
      negative scoring.

      4. The planning of your field with the cards you draw every round is
      such an awesome gameplay. You are already building an engine for returning
      customer but also expanding and planning for regular customers and new
      ones.


      Must buy!

      but not going to add to my collection as the setting has absolutely no
      appeal to me though I really LOVE James Colmer&apos;s
      &amp;&amp;#35;40;[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3589654/planar-expedition?size=original]I
      liked Planar Expedition&apos;s art too[/url]&amp;&amp;#35;41; cover art
      for the box. The game play has similar mechanics of Brass and Via Nebula
      for route building. Its a nice cool fantasy take on History and its even
      cool that its happening in Australia, but not for us.

      That should be the reason enough, but the KS seems to be for a huge price and its an Ameritrash through and through &amp;&amp;#35;40;with a few euro mechanisms&amp;&amp;#35;41;, hence not getting it. At least not directly from KS.

      Rahdo calls it Hanabi killer.


      Saw the gameplay, it&apos;s a really nice charming game where the
      theme makes so much sense. I mean not because Richard calls this better
      than Hanabi, but after watching the gameplay the whole mechanism makes
      sense here.


      Should get it someday.

    comment: >-
      So Bloodborne, I am going to admit right now before dwelling deep into the
      game, that I DO NOT like this game.

      I tried liking it, I wanted to badly, how could I not? It&apos;s one of my favourite video games and I wanted to love the card game version of the dark Gothic, plague ridden, monster slaying, brutal and punishing world set in Yharnam.


      [b]Reasons I own it:[/b]


      [url=https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/bloodborne-ps4/][size=10][b]BLOODBORNE, the PS4 game[/b][/size][/url]

      That&apos;s it, I got it without checking the gameplay and decided to get it just out of my love &amp; craze I have for the video game.


      [b]Components and presentation[/b]


      It&apos;s a CoolMiniorNot game, so the components are really good, the box also comes with a neat insert that fits everything well. Component wise, it&apos;s worth every penny. 

      The cards are thick, the health dial is really good, the blood-echo tokens feel nice to hold, the player board is a sturdy cardboard.


      I do have a minor quibble with the art, they have taken the artwork from the game and it really didn&apos;t suit well with the dark colour scheme, there is a difference when you see that art on monitor as opposed to a print and they should have done something else. I understand they might have had licensing limits or other issues, but I wish the card game had it&apos;s own artwork.


      The second component that I disliked was the dice, now it could have been the expense in production that they chose to go with a simple dice. But for a game like Bloodborne, to go with the theme, a custom dice would have been brilliant as oppose to this red, yellow and green dice that stands out like an ugly pimple.


      [b]Reasons I don&apos;t like playing it:[/b]


      Bloodborne the card game takes place or tries to emulate [url=http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Chalice+Dungeon]The Chalice Dungeon[/url] from the actual video game, but not quite; As a HUGE Bloodborne fan it&apos;s no way close to a Chalice Dungeon experience. Again, I am not one of those who bicker about a TV series or movie matching my favourite book when the medium is translated over to a different medium, but drawing random monster after monster until you reach a boss isn&apos;t Chalice Dungeon. The enjoyment of Chalice Dungeon in Bloodborne, the video game has so much to do with the exploration and discovering new places. They could have just called it an arena or something.


      So you keep drawing one card after another until you meet the Boss of the level. And on your journey, if you are lucky you might find some good weapon to help you in your battle.

      You then add up your collection of blood echo and trophies earned for score. That&apos;s it. Rinse and Repeat with different monsters.


      It&apos;s mean and its cut-throat and you can mess around with your opponents if you really want to.

      A quote from the rulebook which says you can negotiate but then lie if you want too.


      [q]Players are free to discuss which card they intend to play and negotiate with the other Hunters to try to defeat the creatures in the dungeon. But all cards must be selected and played secretly and simultaneously! You are never required to play a particular card, even if you said you would![/q] And I do not enjoy mean games and when I am playing I am not looking for methods to kick my opponent in the face and laugh about how they didn&apos;t see it coming.



      [b]Favourite gameplay mechanisms[/b]


      Why would I have a favourite gameplay mechanism if I don&apos;t like the game? Well, I do have a few. I never once said that [u]Bloodborne is bad game[/u], it&apos;s just not my cup of tea and it turned out to be something else from what I was expecting.


      - It&apos;s quite easy to teach, not really a gameplay mechanism but I&apos;d rather put it here.

      - The misleading feeling of &quot;semi co-op&quot; where the game itself is a cut-throat competitive game. However, the feel of semi-cop is one aspect they nailed from Chalice Dungeon. You do feel the co-op journey in Bloodborne&apos;s Chalice Dungeon, where you explore with a buddy, minus the explore part.

      - The losing of Blood Echoes. This is probably the laziest choice for a favourite mechanic but I really like the fact that there is that risk and push your luck element involved just like the video game.

      - Everyone gets rewarded, now this again isn&apos;t a gameplay mechanism but something I liked in the game.



      Bloodborne unlike Zombicide Black Plague wasn&apos;t an impulsive buy, I did not do my research before buying the game and that probably is one of the mistake I made. However, like Zombicide I am not planning to trade Bloodborne, and the reason is simply my love for the video game. It&apos;s going to be on my shelf as some kind souvenir or collectible item of a a beloved game from another realm.

      I don&apos;t see it getting played at all, one big reason being Renu will not enjoy the game for sure as 80% game revolves around die rolls with very less option to mitigate it or rather no way to mitigate it &amp;&amp;#35;40;yeah theme, whatever!! War of Ring drips theme and its dice based game I really like with plenty of mitigation options&amp;&amp;#35;41;.


      With all the respect to Mr. Lang that he deserves, I really don&apos;t enjoy any of his games that I have played so far and Bloodborne is no exception &amp;&amp;#35;40;not sure what future holds, may be I will change my mind&amp;&amp;#35;41;.

      I find Bloodborne a drag and a boring 60-90 minutes of rolling dice trying to kill monster with a okay deck-building element to it.


      Love the video game to death, really cannot enjoy the card game.

    wishlistcomment: Played once, really enjoyed the game. Waiting for it to come to the market
      for a decent price to snag it..

      Sadly it&apos;s 3P to 5P but I am sure there will be a variant for
      for 2p. This game would be one exception to the 2P must rule.

    wishlistcomment: Castles of Burgundy is one of my favourite game. And this one definitely
      needs to be in our collection as I see it as Castles of Burgundy on the
      move.

      A game for playing with level 02 muggles and crazy Viking fans. 


      Now CoM is dripping with theme, I would go as far and say its as thematic as Yedo &amp;&amp;#35;40;a game that radiates theme&amp;&amp;#35;41;, this is a sweet treat for people who love viking theme. I like Vikings but in video game not so much in board games and even in general not really crazy about their mythos or tales. 


      For the same reason and few other gameplay related reason this game is not for Renu and me. Played it twice &amp;&amp;#35;40;without the Valhalla expansion, want to play with it&amp;&amp;#35;41; and both the times it was okay&apos;ish. I would play it again for sure but will not be adding it to my collection.

      An excellent design and a gateway euro, considering it for playing with
      level 02 muggles. 

      Eventually though.

    wishlistcomment: Seeing the presentation videos, I am okay by not adding the game to our
      collection.


      WOULD LOVE TO PLAY IT though. I love dice drafting so much, but
      Coimbra&apos;s gameplay didn&apos;t really have that much of an appeal to
      me. The artwork is stunning, love it &amp;&amp;#35;40;was my wallpaper on
      my phone for a long time&amp;&amp;#35;41;.

      On a trip to Yellow Submarine with fellow board game geeks, we found this
      one in English for a second-hand price. When we enquired about the
      game&apos;s maintenance,  the staff told us only rule book was open,
      everything else was intact - the pieces haven&apos;t even been punched
      out. Did not think twice.


      Got it, took some time setting it up - man &apos;oh man, after setting up it looked gorgeous. Absolutely stunning. I just wanted to know all the details about it. So once we familiarized ourselves with the rules. It BEGAN!! The first night in the Dead of Winter!


      So the gameplay itself after round two felt easy to grasp, it&apos;s more about surviving as team than about killing and going on a blood-lust zombie hunt. 

      The &apos;Crossroad Cards&apos; were quite unique to me &amp;&amp;#35;40;also considering the fact that I am new to board games when writing this review&amp;&amp;#35;41;. That damn exposure die was so scary and it would ramp up the tension, so the game went on for couple of rounds. But soon it somehow went into the &quot;let&apos;s get this over with&quot; territory &amp;&amp;#35;40;it was quite late in the night&amp;&amp;#35;41;. I played as Mike Cho and Grey Beard, both of them ended up getting killed. We chose not to eliminate players from the board if their survivor dies.


      I loved many aspect of this game, one of my favorite is the &quot;traitor&quot; part where one of us was a traitor &amp;&amp;#35;40;could have played without it, we chose to have a traitor card&amp;&amp;#35;41;. 

      I love that tension, but not sure if we played it wrong or what happened, the traitor player wasn&apos;t revealed to be one until the last moment. Things got frustrating as we waiting for a long time for one player to finish and it was getting a bit of chore by then.


      So in short, I really enjoyed it - but need to play more of it to kind of grasp the in &amp; outs, understand the traitor aspect of the game a bit more. And I want the traitor to play his/her game of selfishness at the beginning, that will keep everybody awake and tensed.

      While at Surugaya Harshad randomly pulled out the box to ask me if I knew
      about the game, nope first time I saw it there. So came home and checked
      beloved Rahdo&apos;s run through and was hooked to the gameplay.

      What a brilliant masterpiece of a game.

      The engine building, the worker placement and upgrading your play
      board with colonisation couples with the brave and bold decision of adding
      slavery, it&apos;s just elegant and a beautiful deep game with such less
      complexity.

      Absolutely stunning game..

      So after play testing it with the man himself, I thoroughly enjoyed the
      game. Again, this theme has absolutely no appeal to me &amp;&amp;#35;40;I
      am more of a Vinhos person&amp;&amp;#35;41; but after playing it, I am
      reconsidering it. Just like Gaia Project, the gameplay was so good and
      tense as the rounds went up, it was absolutely crazy. 

      Will be involved in a few more playtest, I am sure this is a game that I will be adding to my collection.

    comment: For playing with muggles...
    wishlistcomment: EVENTUALLY.

      To upgrade the complexity of games when playing with muggles. Easy
      to teach and I think a game new board gamers will enjoy.

    wishlistcomment: I love Jamey&apos;s designs. It&apos;s unique and always with a very
      interesting theme. The only issue I have is it&apos;s almost rarely a good
      2 player game &amp;&amp;#35;40;don&apos;t think its an issue but for
      me&amp;&amp;#35;41;.


      Euphoria having seen the gameplay and even played half a game, I can
      live without it not being on my shelf as a collection, thought I would
      play anytime if people want me to.

      Unless this game blows me out of the water with its gameplay, will not be
      getting it. 


      [b]LOVE THE ARTWORK[/b] - but if I want a charming and beautiful anthropomorphic characters I&apos;d rather buy a &apos;physical&apos; story book/comics/novel, don&apos;t really enjoy or get drawn to them in my board games. The game might be terrific, the components look awesome. But just because it has glamour, it doesn&apos;t mean it has a elegant gameplay mechanism and that&apos;s what I want from my games.


      Unless, there is a euro game based on Animal Farm that features no direct take-that conflict :P &amp;&amp;#35;40;wishful thinking&amp;&amp;#35;41;

      The game features direct player conflict, hence would love to play but not a game Renu &amp; I would choose to take out.

      This was again a recommendation by a fellow board gamer/geek, who happens
      to own Forbidden Island. 

      I wanted a co-operative game where it is one VS. game and he said blindly go for this one.


      Oh man, did we enjoy it... but damn! this game was tough. We lost twice due to dehydration and some bad decisions we took during the gameplay and once we played on a very high difficulty level. Need to play this again and beat the bloody game. 


      I cannot recommend this enough to people who want an easy to setup, easy to teach, mid-level game to enjoy with friends. And it&apos;s ranked 217 on BGG which is a big deal in my opinion.


      Go for it, don&apos;t hesitate. Trust me you will love it. Just start at a lower difficulty level that&apos;s all. $@&amp;#35;! those Sun-Beat down cards.

      Love the game, the only reason to get rid of it is to get the big box
      edition.

      The basic version is good, but it&apos;s gets boring and stale after 2 plays. So need those awesome expansions. 

      Recent KS is so expensive though.

    wishlistcomment: The theme dammit, I really dislike space theme and alien factions and all
      that. [b]BUT THIS GAME IS JUST SO GOD DAMN GOOD.[/b]


      I might still go with Clans of Caledonia rather than Gaia Project. 3
      people near me own it, so no need to get it anytime soon.


      But - WHAT A BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED GAMEPLAY!

      Don&apos;t think I will ever buy this game &amp;&amp;#35;40;at least for
      now that&apos;s what I think&amp;&amp;#35;41;. 


      Played 01 scenario and wasn&apos;t really that impressed, but of course need to play through more scenarios and then judge the game

    wishlistcomment: Had heard a lot of good things about the game. Man Vs Meeple&apos;s Jeremy
      really praises this game a lot and need I say, Rahdo loves it too.


      1. Dice Drafting &amp;&amp;#35;40;one of my fav game
      mechanism&amp;&amp;#35;41;

      2. Resource &amp;&amp;#35;40;food&amp;&amp;#35;41; management and
      how you want to serve a customer and what dice you want to take

      3. The puzzle of Room in terms of bonus points scored based on row
      and coloumn and other criteria

      4. In a 2 player, the round token is damn interesting, which is
      non-standard

      5. The crazy easter egg type names of people related to BGs

      6. Variable setup


      Over all love it, just not buying it now because of space and time
      constraint, but a 100% collection worthy.

      played any of his other games. La Granja piqued my interest after playing
      Agra &amp;&amp;#35;40;not really into Solarius Mission&amp;&amp;#35;41;.
      Rahdo calls it the design love child of Stephan Feld &amp; Uwe Rosenberg
      :P

      And oh man! Is this gaming terrific


      1. Brilliant multi use of Card

      2. Love the dice workflow in the game

      3. The general trade good strategy in the game is amazing

      4. The overall phase based gameplay is aweosme

      5. Chain-combo action that occurs is just bloody brilliant


      Must have, and will get it eventually, no hurry.

    wishlistcomment: TGZ over FCM, haven&apos;t played any other Splotter games except FCM, but
      the decision to get TGZ is after watching Rahdo&apos;s run-through and
      Heavy Cardboard&apos;s play-through.


      1. I really liked the gameplay where, if you take something that is
      advantageous to you, you will have to score more.

      2. The permanent God worshiping is so cool, has to be such a careful
      decision.

      3. As bland as the board is, I still love the look of it and how the
      board affects so much of your actions

      4. The auction, even with two player is great and Keyflower like
      mechanism where you use other player&apos;s building but the player gets
      benefits.

      5. Pure skill based game and so much to plan and do, for sure this
      would give as such a sweet headache.

      I was recommended this game by my fellow board game geek &amp; friend. 

      In the beginning, I was quite skeptical about getting it.


      However, after watching couple of videos I was hooked by it&apos;s unique gameplay and style. There was a deep tension building up as the game went on. 

      It&apos;s a small cute box with beautiful illustrations, doesn&apos;t take much time to setup and it&apos;s easy to teach.


      I loved it and highly recommend it to anyone, even those new to board/card games.


      Will get the At your Order Expansion soon.

      ***One of the games coming to me in 2018


      First off, don&apos;t give a slightest dang! what other think - I FREAKING LOVE THE ART STYLE.

      There is a reason why Johannes Sich chose the character to be represented stylised; irrelevant to be mentioned in my wishlist.


      Watching Rahdo&apos;s run-through &amp;&amp;#35;40;oh! what would I do without beloved Rahdo&amp;&amp;#35;41;, this was an instant clink for me. I remember seeing &quot;Haspelknecht&quot; at Shoshen Grande on my first visit there with Old Hunter, the game did attract me then but was too expensive and my taste as a brand new &amp;&amp;#35;40;board game virgin&amp;&amp;#35;41; did not approve that Haspelknecht  didn&apos;t have miniatures &amp;&amp;#35;40;I am laughing at that virgin self right now&amp;&amp;#35;41;.


      1. Surprisingly thematic 

      2. The disk selection mechanism is brilliant

      3. The technology upgrades and the paths you can take with this game is awesome

      4. The bonus action mechanism of using 2 workers to do same action feels so rewarding

      5. The challenge the game presents through rain water clogging and going deeper into the mine feels so good when you think of it thematically

      6. The game is fast paced, over in about 1hr-1.5hrs but offers the nice feeling of having played a bigger epic strategy game like Vinhos of Madeira.

      7. Finally, though this isn&apos;t the first thing I go for, but the artwork - it just sings to me and I want it on my shelf to add to my Quined Games collection.

      Would not add to my collection as the 2 player seemed too cut-throat
      for my taste.

      explained &amp;&amp;#35;40;absolutely excited&amp;&amp;#35;41; I going to

    comment: Got it couple of days back at Yellow Submarine. Played it with my fellow
      board gamers, it was really fun. Sailing a ship with opponents blocks were
      really fun. We enjoyed the &quot;take that&quot; element too.


      Overall a really fun and easy to learn. Enjoyed it and would
      recommend it to anyone looking for a semi-complex, family friendly, easy
      to learn Egypt based thematic game.


      And yes, you literally build pyramids in this one.

    wishlistcomment: Oh my board game lord, what can I say? [b]AM I in freaking love with this
      game!!!![/b]

      Its so bloody expensive to ship, and I need a bit of time in hands
      from all the new games I have currently, hence just holding it off
      temporarily, but in 2018, this beast of a design is to be mine.


      1. Simplicity of turn in terms of game play

      2. Chain, inter-locking mechanisms

      3. Building and resource management

      4. Non-direct-conflict based player interaction

      5. STUNNING looking mural style artwork and board

      6. VITAL LACERDA ;&amp;&amp;#35;41;

    wishlistcomment: Eventually to play level 02 muggles or to give as gifts.


      Renu and I don&apos;t think LoW is a game we will need to add to our
      collection as [thing=117915][/thing] is waaaaaaayyyyy deeper, richer,
      elegant and in some regards better game &amp;&amp;#35;40;my
      opinion&amp;&amp;#35;41; than LoW. [thing=117915][/thing] is what LoW
      wishes it was.


      LoW is a good game and I enjoyed playing it and will play it again,
      but comparing similar game mechanics - [thing=117915][/thing] is way
      better.

      Just because of the D&amp;D setting this game got popularised so
      much.

    comment: I am not into co-op games with a few exceptions here and there. But this
      one is really awesome game without any of the huge rules and &quot;roll a
      die to resolve&quot; effects.


      Really, really like it. Osprey Games has put out another gem.

    wishlistcomment: There is not much to say about Madeira apart from calling it an excellent
      design by Nuno &amp; Paulo.


      1. The depth of gameplay

      2. Simple turns but can trigger a domino effect

      3. The dice placement that can help you but also help another player

      4. Non-direct-conflicting game

      5. Interconnected mechanism &amp;&amp;#35;40;kind of related to
      point&amp;#35;02&amp;&amp;#35;41;


      A must have, another one for 2018

    comment: I can see why this game is so famous among some people. But just not my
      cup of tea. Going to contradict myself here though - i will still
      occasionally play it and if there is any Cathullu or Lovecraft based co-op
      Ameritrash I want to play among many others - this would be it.

      Like it more than Eldtrich Horror and I have not played Arkham
      Horror &amp;&amp;#35;40;not planning too&amp;&amp;#35;41;
    wishlistcomment: I really like the game, but probably will never buy and add to the
      collection.

    wishlistcomment: Rahdo calls it the Through the Ages killer, but I want to play both before
      deciding which one is the murderer and which gets killed.


      - Really like the simplicity of the game play compared to TTA

      - Love the non-aggressive military actions

      - I like the board setup of Nations more than TTA

      - The amount of time Nations take is lesser than TTA


      But I am going to refrain from buying Nations anytime soon. I will
      play it and if it really does kill TTA then maybe, but as of now I am not
      getting it.

    wishlistcomment: Based on run through and reading rulebook, I think this is the version of
      Nations I will be getting and not the actual game. Because, Renu wants TTR
      so bad we are getting that. I want Nations so bad, so I am getting this.


      - Plays very similar to actual game

      - I LOVE DICE selection and allocation

      - A bit of randomness, but it is just 2% in the game where the
      random card draw in the actual game contributes almost to the same

      - The decision making is amazing and equally brain burny as the
      actual game

    comment: Renu played it a lot, and from the gameplay explanation, not a game game I
      would really enjoy. So Renu gave it away to her cousin sister who seems to
      enjoy it way more than us.

    comment: >-
      I am giving Onitama 8.5 because this game is something I shall be playing
      this game very often and will be delighted to teach others as well,
      it&apos;s notoriously simple to set up and to teach and it was a pleasure
      to play too.


      I loved the artwork, the calligraphy on the move cards and the playmat is just simply great and lends a lot to the theme of the game. People often compare this to chess, but it isn&apos;t chess, except the part where you move towards your opponent and you cut your opponent&apos;s pawns &amp;&amp;#35;40;students&amp;&amp;#35;41;.


      I would go ahead and say that this is simpler than chess to teach and play. 

      But don&apos;t get me wrong, there is a complex game that hides in this simplistic gameplay.

      You really need to think 4-5 steps ahead before you move.


      Overall, loved it - highly recommend it. Can&apos;t wait for the Sensei&apos;s Path expansion.

    comment: I don&apos;t own game, a friend of mine has it and he randomly took it out
      one evening for us to play. Going by it&apos;s cover and name, I probably
      wouldn&apos;t have picked it up. But have to say I really enjoyed playing
      it.


      Will I buy it, definitely - but I do have other games that I want
      before I add Patchwork to my shelf.

      Okay so having played 2 games of PoE, I think its safe to go with Lords of
      Waterdeep rather than this one.


      [b]Its just so BORING[/b] for Renu and me. There is absolutely nothing you do in this. Lords of Waterdeep&apos;s intrigues are at least a bit involving. I am holding both PoE and LoW in the same frame and I think LoW is a better choice for gateway WP and BG in general as a next step from 	

      Sheriff of Nottingham or 5 Min Dungeon.

    wishlistcomment: Played it twice and really enjoyed the shared worker pool, that was
      brilliant. I like it better than Champions of Midgard
      &amp;&amp;#35;40;comparing 2 Viking themed game - given a choice I will
      chose &apos;Raiders&apos;&amp;&amp;#35;41;. This game has much more to do,
      and it&apos;s quite thematic &amp;&amp;#35;40;but I would argue that
      Champions of Midgard is way more thematic and gorgeous
      looking&amp;&amp;#35;41;.


      Now here&apos;s the reason I will never add this game to my list
      &amp;&amp;#35;40;I will play it again though, anytime&amp;&amp;#35;41;
      even though I really ENJOYED the core game mechanism of the game and there
      is a lot you do, which is great, but:-


      - The card draw luck &amp;&amp;#35;40;this is
      annoying&amp;&amp;#35;41; - hate it

      - The take-that card, though less it&apos;s still there

      - the dice roll when raiding to see the total strength, seriously?
      Already giving more glory to players who have a good average strength in
      the first place that they received from random card draw.

      - I find the quest token VP, in the end, is just crazy, one can
      probably win with collecting as many quests as possible.


      Liked the game a lot, but not something I will ever buy.

    comment: Too cut throat for us. I really liked the game, Renu hated it and she just
      couldn&apos;t play the game due to its theme which was a bit violent for
      her, partly due to my thematic explanation of what the scientist would do
      to the Raptor babies after they catch them :P

    wishlistcomment: Would love to play this game someday, but I prefer Pre-History over this.
      In terms of gameplay and the look and feel.

      LOVE the artwork of RoT, but then again my personal taste comes
      butting in as to what I like in BG art, and just bored of seeing
      mobile-game style artwork in board games, of course my opinion.

    comment: Played enough it getting played and eating up space.

      Now we have better games with similar mechanics. And not interested
      in getting more expansion content for it. So bye-bye Catan.

      Played it thrice and with no fault of the games, however it was really
      bored and played it three times to see if we like it after multiple play,
      just not for us - I&apos;d rather play CoB: The Dice Game or Oddville or
      something. But I see how it can be used to convert muggles - the game is
      just gorgeous and stunning.

    wishlistcomment: Did not enjoy the game at all. I know its a favourite darling of many
      gamers, but I am just never playing this game again. Not with experienced
      player at least.

    comment: Played enough, barely comes out and the base game got stale now for us.
      Hate seeing it sit on the shelf without getting played. So gave it away,

    comment: Not interested in the game for 2 players, but for playing with muggles
    wishlistcomment: Eventually.

      Even if I buy, this is to play with level 02 muggles :D


      Just for Renu and me, not really. Will take a pass on 2 player even
      though it seems like a good 2 player game.

    wishlistcomment: Since I have Quadropolis now, I might hold off of buying Suburbia, heard a
      lot of about this game and some say this is way better than Quadropolis.


      I love playing Quadropolis, the only issue is the game&apos;s
      over-all presentation. It bores me and the cutsy mobile game type, the
      ones like Clash of Clans really bothers me in board games. So might
      consider Suburbia eventually.

      Prepared to be surprised. She says she loved the gameplay, enough reasons for me to get it.

    comment: Renu abhors this game and even I got bored of it - just way too much
      randomness and nothing that interesting going on - would rather play
      Hanmikoji or Kingdomino or something.

    wishlistcomment: Still haven&apos;t decided whether to get this or not, the theme of the
      game isn&apos;t really compelling. Yes, it has Concordia&apos;s card play
      system integrated to it. But the game itself didn&apos;t really intrigue
      me after reading the rules.


      EDIT &amp;#35; 02

      Not buying the game, the setting really doesn&apos;t interest me
      even if the concept is abstracted to a good mechanic. So will play but
      wont buy.

      Eventually, this is definitely not a 2 player game &amp;&amp;#35;40;I can
      be wrong as I read that it plays with 2player and Harshad also said that
      it&apos;s really good 2player&amp;&amp;#35;41;. 

      Otherwise, to play with a group.

      but wow, what an awesome game. Played it twice till now. Both the times as Dragon.

      I loved it anyway. Copy-pasting from Renu&apos;s wishlist comments.

      Many many aspects of BG mechanics we really like.


      1&amp;&amp;#35;41; Visiting expert acts like a special character wherein s/he gives you a special ability that you can perform in your turn. It becomes part of your collection

      2&amp;&amp;#35;41; Board is interactive as well as tighter than the first edition. 

      3&amp;&amp;#35;41; Region-based wine, that is each region produces different types of wine

      4&amp;&amp;#35;41; Weather affecting the wine. In short real-life stimulation of vineyard.

      5&amp;&amp;#35;41; Every factor of the game can be utilized in some or the other form. Even experts can be sold after their use is done to gain more standing in the society.

      6&amp;&amp;#35;41; Money is tight but can be earned through worker placement. So it is just tight enough to stimulate competition.

      this is what happens when you get something impulsively.

      After playing Jaipur, I realized why it&apos;s on the list of
      everyone&apos;s top 10 for 2 player game.


      Even though there is a slight luck involved in the game, the game does have a tiny amount of strategy in terms of selecting cards. The camel cards and how it plays is really nice, where you have to take all the camels or none. It might seem like an advantage in the beginning but having a lot of camel herd can be anti-climatic for certain scenarios.


      It&apos;s very simple, easy to teach, well made and I think a peaceful game :&amp;&amp;#35;41;


      If you want to introduce your spouse to board-gaming slowly, dose-by-dose and ramp up the complexity, then Jaipur is a good start for that. And even then, down the line, you will still take it out to play. 


      Really like the game.

      - Damn easy to travel with

      - Literally no learning curve

      - Very less table space needed

      - Easy to teach young new gamers


      Will keep it, simple and even though non-existent theme, I really like the feudal Japanese setting.
