- title: 'Coup: Rebellion G54'
  description: |
    This game takes the same simple Coup mechanisms and rules, but with a variable deck of 25 characters, and in each game you choose to play with five out of the 25, so the relative power and advantage of each character changes from game to game.

    This is more of a gamer's game than the original Coup as you can create a deck to increase bluffing, deduction, negotiation or luck.

- title: 'Codenames'
  description: |
    In Codenames, two teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Spymasters give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. Their teammates try to guess words of the right color while avoiding those that belong to the opposing team.

    This has been a hit at every game session we've done. It makes for some amazing moments when your team manages to guess the right words on a wildly audacious clue and equally when the other team messes up a rather easy one.
