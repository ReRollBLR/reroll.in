    description: 'In the card game Greed, crime lords &amp;&amp;#35;40;the players&amp;&amp;#35;41; try to earn more money than anyone else through clever use of their cards.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;At the start of the game, each player receives a random hand of twelve cards from a deck of 80. Players draft one card, pass the remaining cards left, draft a second card, pass again, draft a third card, pass again, then the game changes; players simultaneously choose and reveal a card, carrying out its effects, then they draft another card, pass the remaining cards, play again, and so on until ten &amp;quot;playing&amp;quot; rounds have passed, at which point the game ends and players tally their holdings.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The card types are thugs, holdings and actions. Thugs and holdings might have a cost to be played &amp;&amp;#35;40;perhaps cash paid to the bank or the discarding of a holding&amp;&amp;#35;41; or a condition that you must meet &amp;&amp;#35;40;having two thugs, for example, or a collection of symbols on cards in your possession&amp;&amp;#35;41; in addition to an effect, which is unique to each card. &amp;&amp;#35;40;Each action has a unique effect as well.&amp;&amp;#35;41; When you play a holding with one or more symbols, you place a token on that card for each symbol on it and an additional token for each symbol of that type already in your possession. These tokens are worth $10k each at the end of the game, and you add this value to whatever cash you&apos;ve collected through your card plays.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;'
