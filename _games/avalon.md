game:
    name: 'The Resistance: Avalon'
    description: 'The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred&apos;s unscrupulous minions. These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur&apos;s servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is discovered, all will be lost.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The Resistance: Avalon is a standalone game, and while The Resistance is not required to play, the games are compatible and can be combined.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;'
