    description: 'In an abandoned warehouse a gangster band is splitting its loot, but they can&apos;t agree on the split! It&apos;s time to let the guns talk and soon everyone is aiming at everyone. The richest surviving gangster wins the game!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Ca$h &apos;n Guns helps you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. The goal is to have more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Each round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play. First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what&apos;s up for grabs. Next, players load their guns by secretly selecting either a &amp;quot;Bang!&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;Click! Click!&amp;quot; card from their hand. The Boss counts to three, and on &amp;quot;Three&amp;quot; each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who&apos;s pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent&apos;s eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn&apos;t want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Everyone who&apos;s pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who&apos;s the target of a &amp;quot;Bang!&amp;quot; takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot. Starting with the Boss, everyone still in the round takes one loot card at a time from the table &amp;mdash; money, diamonds, paintings, the position of Boss, medical care &amp;&amp;#35;40;to remove a wound&amp;&amp;#35;41;, or a new bullet &amp;&amp;#35;40;to add a &amp;quot;Bang!&amp;quot; card to your hand&amp;&amp;#35;41; &amp;mdash; until everything has been claimed.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;After eight rounds, the game ends. Whoever has the most diamonds receives a big bonus, and paintings score based on the number of them that you&apos;ve collected. Whoever has the most valuable stash wins!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;'
