2019 was ReRoll's most successful year yet. Here's some of the highlights:

* Did our largest event ever with 194 attendees - [International Tabletop Day 2019](https://insider.in/international-board-game-day-jun1-2019/event)
* Added [@Ishira_Bhattacharya](https://forum.reroll.in/u/ishira_bhattacharya) and [@Navin](https://forum.reroll.in/u/navin)  to our core team
* Started a second weekly meetup - [Heavy Cardboard Wednesdays](https://forum.reroll.in/t/heavy-cardboard-wednesdays-go-native-hsr-layout-every-wednesday/39) in HSR Layout
* Launched the [ReRoll Forums](https://forum.reroll.in/)


In July 2019 we moved entirely to online ticketing for all of our events. While initially this was met with some resistance, everyone eventually seems to have gotten onboard with the idea. This has substantially eased our accounting and logistics hassles.

One of the upsides of having all our ticketing and check-ins digital is that we now have a much better understanding of our audience profile. While we don't have all of 2019's data digitally, we've put together some data that we thought would be useful to share with the community.

We're looking forward to building on this platform and growing the board game hobby in India even further in 2020!
