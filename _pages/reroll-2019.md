2019 was ReRoll's most successful year yet. Here's some of the big things we did this year

* Did our largest event ever with 194 attendees - International Tabletop Day 2019
* Added Ishira and Navin to our organizing team
* Started a second weekly meetup - Heavy Cardboard Wednesdays in HSR Layout
* Launched the ReRoll Forums


In July 2019 we moved entirely to online ticketing for all of our events. While initially this was met with some resistance, everyone eventually seems to have gotten onboard with the idea. This has substantially eased our accounting and logistics hassles.

One of the upsides of having all our ticketing and check-ins digital is that we now have a much better understanding of our audience profile. While we don't have all of 2019's data digitally, we've been managed to put together some things that we thought is useful to share with the community.
