## What is International Board Game Day?
Also known as International Tabletop Day, it's an annual celebration of board games that happens around the world.

## Who is this for?
Newcomers, especially people who’ve only played games like Monopoly, Cluedo, Pictionary, etc. There is a massive world of creative, challenging, and incredibly fun board games out there that we in India don’t ever hear about. This is an opportunity for you to get a glimpse of it.

More than the games themselves, the social experience is what's excellent. It is absolutely the number one reason we people play board games regularly. You find out new things about your own friends (like how they are incredibly good liars when they need to be) and you meet new people. It makes for memorable moments that you’ll be talking about long after it’s over.

Most importantly, you’ll definitely leave with more friends than when you walked in. You don't need to know any of the rules or have played games like this before. We’ll be around to help set them up, explain the rules, and answer any questions you may have while playing.

## What kinds of games are these?
We've got a curated list of games that we think are a great way to introduce people. They span strategy, social deception, cooperative, party, etc. Here are a few to get an idea of what we mean:

**Dead of Winter** - Where you fight off a herd of zombies with your SO.

**Forbidden Desert** - Try to survive and escape the desert after you and your friends crash land your plane.

**Coup** - You and your friends are part of a resistance group and will lie, steal, and deceive your way to overthrow the maligned government.

**Ticket to Ride** - Where you build a railroad network across Europe against your friends.

## Are there any tournaments?
Yes! During the event, we have two tournaments - one on **Pandemic**, and the other on **Star Realms**. The winners will receive a copy of Pandemic and Machi Koro respectively, courtesy **The Bored Yogi**.

## How much is the ticket?
This ticket is Rs. 500, of which Rs. 300 is redeemable on food and beverages (it’s a very good menu). Rs. 200 is what we charge to cover for the wear and tear on the games, our time, and some profit to allow us to buy new games for future events.
